🎉 Excited to share my second task as a Web Development Intern at SkillCraftTechnology! 🎉

I just completed building a professional and interactive stopwatch web application as part of my internship. 🕒 This project was a great opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

Key features of the stopwatch include:

⏱️ Start, pause, and reset functionality
🏁 Lap time tracking to measure time intervals accurately
💻 A responsive and modern UI with images for a professional look
🔗 You can check out the project demonstration here:https://skillcrafttechnologywd2.netlify.app/

This has been an amazing learning experience, and I'm looking forward to taking on more exciting challenges!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback! 😊
